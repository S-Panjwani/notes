## <span><b>1. Main Literary Devices</b></span>

### Allusion

<b>Definition:</b> An indirect reference to a person, place, thing, or idea of historical, cultural, literary, or political significance. It doesn't describe in detail the thing it refers to.

<p class="example" style="color: #90caf9; font-style: italic;">
<b>Example:</b> "He was no <b>Scrooge</b>, despite his wealth, and always donated generously to charity."
</p>

<p class="identifier" style="color: #81c784;">
<b>How to identify it:</b> Spot a <em>brief, unexplained mention</em> like the <b>"Scrooge"</b> here, which relies on you knowing the famous character without any extra description.
</p>

### Analogy

<b>Definition:</b> A comparison between two things that are otherwise unlike, used to explain or clarify an idea. It's more elaborate than a simile or metaphor.
 
<p class="example" style="color: #90caf9; font-style: italic;">
<b>Example:</b> "Learning to ride a bike is <b>like learning to manage a small business</b>. You need to balance, stay focused, and pedal consistently..."
</p>

<p class="identifier" style="color: #81c784;">
<b>How to identify it:</b> Look for an <em>extended comparison</em> such as the phrase <b>"like learning to manage a small business"</b>, where a complex idea is explained through a familiar concept.
</p>

### Anaphora

<b>Definition:</b> The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses or sentences.
 
<p class="example" style="color: #90caf9; font-style: italic;">
<b>Example:</b> "<b>We shall fight</b> in France, <b>we shall fight</b> on the seas and oceans..."
</p>

<p class="identifier" style="color: #81c784;">
<b>How to identify it:</b> Notice the repeated phrase <b>"We shall fight"</b> starting multiple consecutive clauses or sentences.
</p>

### Antithesis

<b>Definition:</b> Two opposite ideas placed together in a sentence for contrasting effect.
 
<p class="example" style="color: #90caf9; font-style: italic;">
<b>Example:</b> "<b>Many are called, but few are chosen.</b>"
</p>

<p class="identifier" style="color: #81c784;">
<b>How to identify it:</b> Identify strongly contrasting ideas in parallel structure, like <b>"Many are called, but few are chosen."</b>
</p>

<p class="example" style="color: #90caf9; font-style: italic;">
<b>Example:</b>

- <i>Internal:</i> <i>If only I had remembered my umbrella. Now I’m soaked.</i>
- <i>External:</i> "<b>Good morning, everyone!</b>" he said cheerfully.
</p>
 
<p class="identifier" style="color: #81c784;">
<b style="color: #81c784;">How to identify it:</b>

- <b>Internal:</b> Look for <i>italicized thoughts</i> or narration of private thoughts like <i>"If only I had remembered..."</i>
- <b>External:</b> Look for <i>direct quotes</i> in speech marks like <b>"Good morning, everyone!"</b>
</p>

### Consonance

**Definition:** Repetition of consonant sounds within or at the end of nearby words.
 
<p class="example" style="color: #90caf9; font-style: italic;">

</p>

<p class="identifier" style="color: #81c784;">
<b>How to identify it:</b> Focus on repeated <em>consonant sounds</em> within or at the end of words close together, like the repeated <b>"ll"</b> sound in <b>"all," "fall," and "ball."</b>
</p>

### Foreshadowing

<b>Definition:</b> A writer gives an advance hint of what is to come later in the story.
 
<p class="example" style="color: #90caf9; font-style: italic;">
<b>Example:</b> In a mystery novel, a character repeatedly mentions their <b>fear of heights</b>, only to later find themselves trapped on a tall building.\n
</p>

<p class="identifier" style="color: #81c784;">
<b>How to identify it:</b> Look for subtle clues or repeated details like the <b>"fear of heights"</b> that hint at future events.
</p>

<p class="identifier" style="color: #81c784;">

</p>

### Juxtaposition

</p>

<p class="identifier" style="color: #81c784;">

<p class="example" style="color: #90caf9; font-style: italic;">

## <span><b>2. Structure of Text (Pacing, Tone, Parallelism)</b></span>

### Pacing

<b>Definition:</b> The speed at which the narrative unfolds or information is presented.
 
<p class="example" style="color: #90caf9; font-style: italic;">
<b>Example:</b> A thrilling chase scene described with short, sharp sentences: "<b>He ran. The dog barked. Footsteps pounded.</b>"
</p>

<p class="identifier" style="color: #81c784;">
<b>How to identify it:</b> Notice sentence and paragraph length and detail. Fast pacing uses short sentences and rapid events like <b>"He ran. The dog barked."</b>
</p>

### Tone

<b>Definition:</b> The author’s or narrator’s attitude toward the subject or audience.
 
<p class="example" style="color: #90caf9; font-style: italic;">
<b>Example:</b> A diary entry saying "<b>I’m so sad about the disaster.</b>" shows a personal, emotional tone.
</p>

<p class="identifier" style="color: #81c784;">
<b>How to identify it:</b> Analyze word choice and imagery. Emotional or informal words like <b>"I’m so sad"</b> indicate tone.
</p>

### Parallelism

<b>Definition:</b> Use of similar grammatical structures to create balance and emphasis.
 
<p class="example" style="color: #90caf9; font-style: italic;">
<b>Example:</b> "<b>She wanted to cook, to clean, and to read.</b>"
</p>

<p class="identifier" style="color: #81c784;">
<b>How to identify it:</b> Look for repeated sentence structures or lists with similar phrasing, like the repeated "to" phrases in <b>"to cook, to clean, and to read."</b>\n
</p>

## <span>3. Similar Devices &amp; How to Differentiate</span>

### Simile vs. Metaphor

<p class="similarity" style="color: #ffffff;">
<b>Similarity:</b> Both compare two unlike things to create meaning.
</p>

<p class="difference" style="color: #90caf9;">
<b>Difference:</b> Similes use "like" or "as" (<b>"as brave as a lion"</b>), while metaphors say something <em>is</em> something else (<b>"He is a lion in battle."</b>).
</p>

<p class="tip" style="color: #81c784;">
<b>Tip:</b> If you see "like" or "as," it’s a simile. No "like" or "as"? Metaphor.
</p>

### Allusion vs. Symbolism

<p class="similarity" style="color: #ffffff;">
<b>Similarity:</b> Both refer to something beyond the literal text.
</p>

<p class="difference" style="color: #90caf9;">
<b>Difference:</b> An allusion is a brief, indirect reference (often cultural or literary), while symbolism is a broader use of objects or ideas to represent themes or concepts.
</p>

<p class="tip" style="color: #81c784;">
<b>Tip:</b> Allusions usually name or hint at something specific outside the text (e.g., a famous person), symbolism is embedded meaning in objects within the text.
</p>

### Irony vs. Sarcasm

<p class="similarity" style="color: #ffffff;">
<b>Similarity:</b> Both involve saying one thing but meaning another.
</p>

<p class="difference" style="color: #90caf9;">
<b>Difference:</b> Irony is a broad literary device involving contrast (situational, verbal, dramatic), while sarcasm is a sharp, often mocking verbal irony aimed to hurt or ridicule.
</p>

<p class="tip" style="color: #81c784;">
<b>Tip:</b> If it’s mean or mocking speech, it’s probably sarcasm. If it’s situational or dramatic contrast, it’s irony.\n
</p>

### Anaphora vs. Repetition

<p class="similarity" style="color: #ffffff;">
<b>Similarity:</b> Both involve repeating words or phrases for effect.
</p>

<p class="difference" style="color: #90caf9;">
<b>Difference:</b> Anaphora is repetition specifically at the beginning of successive sentences or clauses; general repetition can be anywhere in the sentence.
</p>

<p class="tip" style="color: #81c784;">
<b>Tip:</b> Check if the repeated phrase is at the start of lines—if yes, anaphora.
</p>

### Hyperbole vs. Overstatement

<p class="similarity" style="color: #ffffff;">
<b>Similarity:</b> Both exaggerate reality for effect.
</p>

<p class="difference" style="color: #90caf9;">
<b>Difference:</b> Hyperbole is an obvious, often humorous exaggeration; overstatement may be less obvious and sometimes accidental.
</p>

<p class="tip" style="color: #81c784;">
<b>Tip:</b> If the exaggeration is extreme and clearly not meant to be literal, it’s hyperbole.
</p>

### Oxymoron vs. Paradox

<p class="similarity" style="color: #ffffff;">
<b>Similarity:</b> Both involve contradictions.
</p>

<p class="difference" style="color: #90caf9;">
<b>Difference:</b> Oxymoron is a brief phrase combining contradictory words (<b>"deafening silence"</b>), paradox is a longer statement that seems contradictory but reveals truth.\n
</p>

<p class="tip" style="color: #81c784;">
<b>Tip:</b> Short phrase with contradictions? Oxymoron. Longer, meaningful contradiction? Paradox.
</p>
